some 2d old skool demo effect fing

TODO
----
Just about everything :).. But specifically:

 * Add a build process to merge Cognition.js, NktxTro0001.js and IntroLauncher.js into a single file.
 * Minify the single js file.
 * Pack any additional libraries into single file.
 * ~Can we encode ProTracker chip modules into JSON and pack into file?~ **Yes!** Well, work in progress but doing it with the [Cognition.ModulePacker](https://github.com/rarelyprolific/Cognition.ModulePacker).
 * Add effects into Cognition - This will be the demo engine!
 * Use effects from NktxTro0001 - This will be the intro!
 * Set up an FPS counter!
 * Finish the module replayer code!
 * Finish the vu-meter code!
